# Predictive Time-Series Modeling of Hydrologic Data

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting hydrologic data using statistical and time-series modeling techniques. The goal is to identify significant trends, periodicities, and predict future water conditions for effective water resource planning.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

- Conducted hypothesis testing (paired tests, rank-sum tests, ANOVA) and correlation analysis to identify significant trends and relationships in hydrologic data.
- Developed time-series forecasting models including:
  - Autoregressive (AR)
  - Moving Average (MA)
  - ARIMA
  - Non-parametric models
- Performed frequency-domain analysis to detect key periodicities and long-term trends.
- Evaluated predictive performance using RÂ² (~0.77) and goodness-of-fit tests.
